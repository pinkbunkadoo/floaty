Floaty is an app for displaying images, transparently, above other desktop windows.

Supported image formats include PNG, JPEG and other web browser supported types.

# Getting started

- Drag one or more images onto the drop window
- Make the desired adjustments to any images
- Tap the eye icon or press slash (/) on the keyboard to enter covert mode*
- Tap the tray icon to leave covert mode</li>

* In covert mode images are non-interactive and appear above all other desktop windows

Floaty requires Electron https://electronjs.org/ to run at the moment. A standalone build is coming.
