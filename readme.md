Floaty is an app for displaying images, transparently, above other desktop windows. Each image can be resized and moved as you would a regular window.

Supported image formats include PNG, JPEG and other web browser compatible types.

<h3>Installation</h3>

Floaty requires you have Electron installed, in order to run. A standalone build is coming soon. If you are not familiar with Electron, see https://electronjs.org/ for further instructions.

<h3>Getting started</h3>

- Drag one or more images onto the drop window
- Make the desired adjustments to any images
- Tap the eye icon or press slash (/) on the keyboard to enter covert mode<sup>1</sup>
- Tap the tray icon to leave covert mode</li>

<sup>1</sup> In covert mode, images are non-interactive and will appear above all other desktop windows
