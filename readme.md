Floaty is an app for displaying images, transparently, above other desktop windows. Images can be resized and moved as you would a regular window.

Supported image formats include PNG, JPEG and other web browser supported types.

<h3>Installation</h3>

Floaty requires Electron to run, however, a standalone build is coming. If you are not familiar with Electron, see https://electronjs.org/ for further instructions.

<h3>Getting started</h3>

- Drag one or more images onto the drop window
- Make the desired adjustments to any images
- Tap the eye icon or press slash (/) on the keyboard to enter covert mode<sup>1</sup>
